# localfwsubs

## V0.2
  Transcribe and translate. 
  GUI to select file or folder, output folder and original language(optional). 
  You can transcibe single file by selecting file, or multiple files by seleclting folder. Original folder as video/audio file for output is recommended. 
  With translate function being added in, you can choose to output biligual subtitles now. 

  Translation: I have adopted local ollama for translation instead of api. Currently qwen14b is used as I have no idea how to eliminate <think> from the Deepseek R1 result for now. 


## V0.1
  Transcribe only. To add in translate. 
  Personally used to transcribe bilingual subtitles to local files, using local faster whisper models and ollama models to translate
